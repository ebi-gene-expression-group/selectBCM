\title{Ranking and plotting of assessment of batch-correction methods}
\usage{
Rank.plot(evaluation)
}
\arguments{
\item{evaluation}{evaluation is the evaluation list obtained from the previous step `evaluation_matrix`.}
}
\value{
A list of two data-frame- (a) raw - simple data-frame output of evaluation matrix and, (b) ranked-
Ranked data-frame of evaluation matrix which has additional column `sumRank` containing final Rank of each method.
Ranks are in descending performance order, i.e. method having score 1 will be the best method. This function also output
`diagnostic plot`, where the x-axis is the evaluation methods and the y-axis is the Rank of each normalization method.
}
\description{
The function performs ranking and plotting of the evaluation data obtained at
the previous step 'batch_evaluationâ€™. Here, methods are ranked on their individual performance,
and finally 'sumRank' is the final Rank of each method for the given dataset.
Rank 1 will be the best performer method.
